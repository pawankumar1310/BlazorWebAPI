        <h3>Tasks for the Final Phase:</h3>
        <h4>
            As we pivot towards the commencement of our main project, we believe it's imperative to get accustomed to the technologies and methodologies we'll predominantly employ.
            With that vision, we are introducing the final phase of your practical training exercise. This phase is crucial, not just as a learning curve, but also as a measure to gauge individual performances, collaborative skills, adaptability to new technologies, and adherence to best practices and standards.

        <h4>
            This phase serves as a precursor to our main project. Emphasis on Blazor for the frontend and .NET API for the backend is in alignment with the tech stack of our upcoming venture.
            We understand that some of these tasks might challenge you, but remember, this exercise is designed to ensure we are well-prepared and adept with the necessary skills and technologies. Tapas and I are available for any clarifications or assistance you might require.
            Remember, the aim isn't just task completion, but understanding, collaboration, and ensuring that we're all on the same page before we embark on our main project. Let's harness this opportunity to learn, grow, and build something phenomenal together.
